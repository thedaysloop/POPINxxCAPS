Hello there, if you're actually reading this, I appreciate you.

I am currently an independent self-taught developer (though I can't say I'm amazing)

I've been coding as a hobby for about 6 years (off and on)

I got pretty serious about learning and making applications ~1 year ago.
Now I just kind of do it to pass the time.
