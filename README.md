Hello there, if you're actually reading this, I appreciate you.

I am currently an independent self-taught developer (though I can't say I'm amazing)

I've been coding as a hobby for about 6 years (off and on)
I got pretty serious about learning and making applications ~1 year ago.

My plan/goal is to make various mobile games, and eventually branch off to console/pc.
Currently though I create bots for myself or gaming communities on discord to enjoy.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning HTML, EJS, and NodeJS
